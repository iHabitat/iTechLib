# CSAPP:  Bits, Bytes, and Integers

## Representing information as bits
### Encoding Byte values
> Byte = 8 bits

- Binary: 00000000 to 11111111
- Decimal: 0 to 255
- Hexadecimal: 00 to FF

### Byte-Oriented Memory Organization
- Programs refer to **Virtual Address**
- Compiler + Run-Time system control allocation

### Machine Words
machine has "word size"
- indicating the nominal size of integer and pointer data.
- the most important system parameter determined by the word size is *the maximum size of the virtual address space*.
- use 32 bits (4 bytes) words, limits addresses to 4GB.

### Word-Oriented Memeory Organization
Addresses specify byte locations
- Address of first byte in word
- Address of successive words differ by 4 (32-bit) or 8 (64-bit)
